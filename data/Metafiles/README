To compare HUR orthologs, IGF2BPs variants and mod-RAPseq binding site metafiles were built by overlapping the peak coordinates of orthologs or variants, respectively, using bedtools merge (v2.21.0). 
For each RBP, the signal within the overlapping regions were retrieved from each replicate of the respective ortholog or variant.
